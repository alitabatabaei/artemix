This Rails app was initially intended for leggings design creation, but morphed into a JS design preview tool.

All of the backend code is now not used, but was a fun excersize in scripted image editing.

The most interesting files are `app/assets/javascripts/designs.js.coffee.erb` and `transform.js.coffee` and the way it interacts with the models of the rails app.
